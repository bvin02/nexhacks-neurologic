## 🧠 What is DecisionOS?

DecisionOS fixes a core failure of stateless LLMs: **they do not remember** why things were decided, what was tried before, or what constraints still apply.

DecisionOS introduces a **persistent cognitive layer** that:

- ✓ Stores durable project memory
- ✓ Governs future responses using that memory
- ✓ Enforces commitments and decisions
- ✓ Detects contradictions and regressions
- ✓ Explains behavior with explicit evidence

**This is not "ChatGPT with memory." This is a continuity operating system for building things.**

## 🏙️ Turing City Theme

Built for the **"Turing City"** hackathon theme - a futuristic city where Artificial General Intelligence is widespread.

In Turing City, intelligence is not just generating answers. It is **continuity, governance, and accountability over time**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Typed Memory System
- **Decisions**: Choices made between alternatives
- **Commitments**: Promises about future behavior
- **Constraints**: Limitations that must be respected
- **Goals**: Objectives to achieve
- **Failures**: What was tried and didn't work
- **Assumptions**: Unstated assumptions made explicit

### 2. Enforcement Engine
Before every response, DecisionOS checks against existing commitments and constraints. If you try to violate a past decision, the system **challenges you with citations**.

### 3. Memory Governance
- Version history for all memories
- Conflict detection between memories
- Deduplication and merging
- Temporal decay and compaction

### 4. Receipts for Everything
Every answer includes debug metadata showing:
- Which memories were used
- Which commitments were checked
- Whether any violations occurred
- Citations to source evidence

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (for serving frontend)
- OpenAI API key OR Google Gemini API key

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
cd NeuroLogic

# Setup backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

Edit `backend/.env`:

```env
# Choose your provider: "openai" or "gemini"
LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# OR Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here
```

### 3. Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 4. Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
# Using Python's built-in server
python -m http.server 3000

# Or using Node
npx serve -l 3000
```

### 5. Open Browser

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎬 Demo Script (3 minutes)

### Act 1: Create Project
1. Click "New Project"
2. Name: "Building a Startup"
3. Goal: "Launch MVP in 3 months"

### Act 2: Make Commitment
Type in chat:
> "We will only use PostgreSQL for our database. This is a hard commitment."

Watch the system extract and store this as a **Commitment**.

### Act 3: Make Decision
Type:
> "We chose React for the frontend because the team has more experience with it."

Watch the system extract a **Decision** with rationale.

### Act 4: Trigger Violation
Type:
> "Let's switch to MongoDB for better scalability."

**Watch the system challenge you:**
> ⚠️ This appears to conflict with existing commitments...
> 
> **COMMITMENT** (created Jan 16, 2026): "We will only use PostgreSQL for our database."
>
> Options: Revise | Create Exception | Override

### Act 5: Show Continuity
1. Click the **"Why?"** button to see which memories were used
2. Go to **Ledger** to see all stored memories
3. Go to **Timeline** to see the history of events
4. **Refresh the page**
5. Ask: "What database are we using?"

The system remembers! 🎉

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Why Not Just "ChatGPT with Memory"?

| ChatGPT | DecisionOS |
|---------|------------|
| Memory is hidden | Memory is visible and governed |
| Remembers facts | Remembers **commitments**, **constraints**, **decisions** |
| No enforcement | **Actively enforces** past decisions |
| Can't explain why | **Every answer has receipts** |
| Stateless reasoning | **Continuity-aware** reasoning |

### Core Principles

1. **Conversation is disposable. Project memory is durable.**
2. **Memory is typed and governed.**
3. **Violations are challenged with citations.**
4. **Everything is versioned and auditable.**

---
